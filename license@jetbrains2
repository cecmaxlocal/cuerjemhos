Okay, let's combine "license," "community," and "JetBrains" to specifically address the licenses for JetBrains' **Community Editions** of their IDEs.

As discussed, while most of JetBrains' flagship IDEs are commercial products requiring a paid subscription, they do offer **free, open-source Community Editions** for some of their products. The most prominent example is **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**.

### JetBrains Community Edition Licenses

The key difference for Community Editions is that they are licensed under a standard, well-known **open-source license**, primarily the **Apache License 2.0**.

**Example: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**

*   **Software:** IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (and other JetBrains Community products like PyCharm Community Edition for Python development).
*   **License:** **Apache License, Version 2.0**
*   **Where to find it:** If you download and install IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, you'll find the license text within the installation directory (often in a `LICENSE.txt` or similar file), and it's also typically referenced during installation and in the "About" dialog of the IDE. The source code repositories for these community editions on GitHub (e.g., `JetBrains/intellij-community`) also clearly state the Apache 2.0 license.

### Why Apache License 2.0 for Community Editions?

*   **Permissive:** The Apache 2.0 license is a permissive open-source license. This means it allows users to:
    *   **Freely use** the software for any purpose (personal, commercial, educational).
    *   **Modify** the source code.
    *   **Distribute** original or modified versions.
    *   **Combine** it with proprietary code.
*   **Conditions:** The main conditions are:
    *   **Attribution:** You must retain copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices.
    *   **State Changes:** If you modify the software, you must clearly indicate that changes were made.
    *   **Patent Grant:** It includes an explicit grant of patent rights from contributors to users, which is a strong protective feature for users.
*   **Encourages Adoption and Contribution:** By using a permissive license like Apache 2.0, JetBrains encourages a wider developer base to use, explore, and even contribute to the open-source parts of their ecosystem. This can lead to a healthier and more robust community around their core technologies.
*   **Compatibility:** Apache 2.0 is highly compatible with many other licenses, making it easy for developers to integrate Community Edition components into larger projects, regardless of those projects' own licensing.

### Distinguishing Community vs. Commercial JetBrains Licenses

It's crucial to understand the difference:

*   **JetBrains Commercial/Professional Editions (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PyCharm Professional, Rider):**
    *   **License:** Proprietary, subscription-based commercial license.
    *   **Terms:** Requires payment for use, often with a "perpetual fallback license" if you maintain a subscription for 12 months.
    *   **Features:** Offer a much broader set of features, integrations, and support compared to their Community counterparts.

*   **JetBrains Community Editions (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA Community, PyCharm Community):**
    *   **License:** Open Source, specifically **Apache License 2.0**.
    *   **Terms:** Free to use, modify, and distribute under the terms of Apache 2.0.
    *   **Features:** Focus on core language support and often lack advanced commercial features (e.g., enterprise framework support, database tools, web development tools in IDEA Community).

So, when you talk about "license community JetBrains," you're almost certainly referring to the **Apache License 2.0** that governs their open-source, free Community Edition products.

The "CEC license" most commonly refers to a license, or rather a **certification and labeling scheme**, from the **California Energy Commission (CEC)**.

It's not a software license like MIT or Apache. Instead, it's about **energy efficiency standards and compliance for appliances and products sold or offered for sale in California.**

### California Energy Commission (CEC) Appliance Efficiency Regulations

The CEC establishes and enforces appliance efficiency standards for a wide range of products. Manufacturers must ensure their products meet these standards and are often required to:

1.  **Test their products:** Products must be tested according to specific procedures to determine their energy consumption or efficiency.
2.  **Certify their products:** Manufacturers must submit certification data to the CEC, demonstrating that their products meet the applicable standards. This often involves listing the product in the CEC's online Appliance Efficiency Database.
3.  **Label their products:** Products are often required to display specific labels (e.g., EnergyGuide labels for some appliances, or CEC-specific markings) indicating their energy efficiency or compliance.

**Key Products Affected by CEC Regulations:**

The CEC regulates a vast array of products, including but not limited to:

*   Televisions
*   Computers and monitors
*   External power supplies
*   Battery chargers
*   Lighting (lamps, luminaires)
*   Refrigerators and freezers
*   Air conditioners
*   Water heaters
*   Dishwashers
*   Washing machines
*   Pool pumps
*   And many more commercial and residential appliances.

**Purpose:**

The goal of the CEC regulations is to:

*   **Reduce energy consumption** in California.
*   **Lower utility bills** for consumers.
*   **Decrease greenhouse gas emissions**.
*   **Promote innovation** in energy-efficient technologies.

**Impact:**

*   **For Manufacturers:** Compliance is mandatory for any product sold in California. Non-compliance can lead to significant fines and restrictions on selling products in the state.
*   **For Consumers:** CEC-certified products assure consumers that they meet certain energy efficiency benchmarks, potentially saving them money on electricity or gas over the product's lifespan.

### Is it *always* the California Energy Commission?

While the CEC license almost certainly refers to the California Energy Commission's appliance efficiency regulations, in very obscure or specific contexts, "CEC" could theoretically stand for something else. However, in the context of "license" or "certification" for products, the **California Energy Commission is the overwhelmingly dominant interpretation.**

**Therefore, if you're asking about a "CEC license," you are most likely referring to a product's compliance with the California Energy Commission's energy efficiency standards.**
